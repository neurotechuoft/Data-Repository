## Gestures:
0: rest

1: extension

2: flexion

3: hand-out

4: hand-in

5: V sign

6: Y sign

7: fist-close

## Experiment:
Rest for 2 seconds, do movement for 2 seconds

## Experiment 1:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Extension (1), rest (0)
1-0

## Experiment 2:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Flexion (2), rest(0)
2-0

## Experiment 3:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Hand-out (3), rest (0)
3-0

## Experiment 4:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Hand-in (4), rest(0)
4-0

## Experiment 5:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

V sign (5), rest (0)
5-0

## Experiment 6:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Y sign (6), rest(0)
6-0

## Experiment 7:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Fist-open (7), rest (0)
7-0

## Experiment 8:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Fist-close (8), rest(0)
8-0

## Experiment 9:
**Perform** the following actions with your hand (no imagination):

Pinch (9), rest (0)
9-0


## Number of trials:
    - 100,000 2-second samples total
    -   20 crops per sample -> 5,000 2-second samples to collect
    -   10 gestures -> 500 2-second samples per gesture
    -   30 samples / gesture / experiment, 2 gestures / experiment -> 16 experiments / gesture
        - 8 with actual movement, 8 imagined movements

## Analysis
    - For sequence 0-1-0-1:
        - preplanning of movement happens at first 0:
            - label 0-1 -> 1
